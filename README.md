> **Source:** COMS3011A Test brief, University of the Witwatersrand (`test_brief.pdf`, 6 pages)
> **Time limit:** 2.5 hours · **Submission:** URL to a public repository

## 1. Overview

Git repositories tend to be very opaque to understanding. Git does not make it easy to understand how a repo has evolved, who has had the most impact where, and what parts of the project are the most volatile.

Your project manager has asked you to build a **Repo Analysis Tool (RAT)** that measures specific metrics of a provided repository. You need to calculate these metrics for:

- each developer (called an **author**),
- each **file**,
- each **directory**, and
- the **entire repository**.

The RAT should be a **web-app dashboard** for multiple repositories. This dashboard should be filterable by:

- a repository
- an author
- a file or directory
- commits — either:
  - a specified period of time, or
  - a manually selected list of commits

It accepts a repository in two forms:

1. A **zip file** of the repo with the `.git` file or directory
2. A **remote repository URL** that is then deeply cloned

## 2. Feature List

The full list of features are:

- Repository Upload: Zip and Clone URL
- Multiple Repository Support
- Author Merging
- Metric Categories:
  - File Metrics
  - Directory Metrics
  - Repository Metrics
  - Commit Set Metrics

### 2.1 Author Merging

Not every commit will have the same author, even if they were made by the same person. To address this, git provides a `.mailmap` to merge different email addresses — the RAT should be able to merge authors using the mailmap. If no mailmap is provided, a user should still be able to merge different authors manually.

> **Note:** Not all features are necessary. Please review the rubric (Section 4) to understand what is needed.

## 3. Metrics

### 3.1 Commit Properties

A commit \(h\) has the following properties:

- A single author \(h[a]\) after author merging.
- A previous commit \(h[p]\) — the initial commit has \(h[p] = h_\emptyset\), an empty commit.
- A commit date \(h[\text{committer-date}]\).
- \(h[F]\) is the set of all files.
  - **Binary files are not measured** (git provides a definition and detection of binary files).
- \(h[D]\) is the set of all directories.
- An object \(o \in h[F] \cup h[D]\) is identified by its path.
  - Rename detection is enabled with a threshold of 50%, so just renaming a file should not change its metrics.
  - Making a change and renaming an object should only have the changes impact its associated metrics. These changes are attributed to its new path.
  - If an object is deleted (it does not exist in \(h\) but does in \(h[p]\)), it should be recorded as a change in the necessary metrics (lines removed) on its path.

### 3.2 Commit Sets

- \(\bar{H}\) is the set of non-merge commits reachable from a specified reference commit \(h_r\) (typically `HEAD`).
- A commit set \(H\) is a subset of \(\bar{H}\).
- The commit set \(H_t\) is the commit history from UNIX timestamp \(t\) to present:

\[ H_t := \{ h \in \bar{H} \mid t \le h[\text{committer-date}] \} \]

- The commit set \(H_{i,j}\) is the commit history from timestamp \(i\) inclusive until timestamp \(j\) exclusive:

\[ H_{i,j} := \{ h \in \bar{H} \mid i \le h[\text{committer-date}] < j \} \]

- \(H[F]\) is the set of all files in the repository:

\[ H[F] := \bigcup_{h \in H} \left( h[F] \cup h[p][F] \right) \]

- \(H[D]\) is the set of all directories (including the root) for the commit set:

\[ H[D] := \bigcup_{h \in H} \left( h[D] \cup h[p][D] \right) \]

### 3.3 File Metrics

**File Added Lines:** the number of lines added on file \(f\) from a commit \(h\) to the previous commit:

\[ l^+_{h,f} \]

**File Removed Lines:** the number of lines removed on file \(f\) from a commit \(h\) to the previous commit:

\[ l^-_{h,f} \]

**File Growth:** the change in number of lines on file \(f\) from a commit \(h\) to the previous commit:

\[ \delta_{h,f} := l^+_{h,f} - l^-_{h,f} \]

**File Churn:** the number of changed lines on file \(f\) from a commit \(h\) to the previous commit:

\[ \lambda_{h,f} := l^+_{h,f} + l^-_{h,f} \]

### 3.4 Directory Metrics

An *immediate object* is an object that is directly below the specified directory:

```
foo/
  bar.txt   -- immediate child of foo
  baz/      -- immediate child of foo
    beef.py -- immediate child of baz
    dead.py -- immediate child of baz
```

A file \(f\) is in a directory \(d\) at a commit \(h\) if it is in \(h[F]\) or \(h[p][F]\) and is an immediate child of \(d\). Similarly for subdirectories \(d'\) and \(h[D], h[p][D]\).

**Directory Added Lines:** the number of added lines across all immediate subdirectories \(d'\) and files \(f\) in directory \(d\):

\[ l^+_{h,d} := \sum_{f \in d} l^+_{h,f} + \sum_{d' \in d} l^+_{h,d'} \]

**Directory Removed Lines:** the number of removed lines across all immediate subdirectories \(d'\) and files \(f\) in directory \(d\):

\[ l^-_{h,d} := \sum_{f \in d} l^-_{h,f} + \sum_{d' \in d} l^-_{h,d'} \]

**Directory Growth:** the net growth across all immediate subdirectories \(d'\) and files \(f\) in directory \(d\):

\[ \delta_{h,d} := \sum_{f \in d} \delta_{h,f} + \sum_{d' \in d} \delta_{h,d'} \]

**Directory Churn:** the churn across all immediate subdirectories \(d'\) and files \(f\) in directory \(d\):

\[ \lambda_{h,d} := \sum_{f \in d} \lambda_{h,f} + \sum_{d' \in d} \lambda_{h,d'} \]

### 3.5 Repository Metrics

Repository metrics are directory metrics on the **root** of the commit tree.

### 3.6 Commit Set Metrics

Over a commit set \(H\), for an object \(o \in H[F] \cup H[D]\):

**Added lines:**

\[ l^+_{H,o} := \sum_{h \in H} l^+_{h,o} \]

**Removed lines:**

\[ l^-_{H,o} := \sum_{h \in H} l^-_{h,o} \]

**Growth:**

\[ \delta_{H,o} := \sum_{h \in H} \delta_{h,o} \]

**Churn:**

\[ \lambda_{H,o} := \sum_{h \in H} \lambda_{h,o} \]

**Modifications:** the number of commits that have at least some change on file or directory \(o\):

\[ \mathbb{I}^n(h, o) := \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \lambda_{h,o} > 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \qquad n_{H,o} := \sum_{h \in H} \mathbb{I}^n(h, o) \]

**Modification frequency** over a file or directory \(o\):

\[ \eta_{H,o} := \begin{cases} \dfrac{n_{H,o}}{|H|} & \text{if } |H| \ne 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]

**Churn rate** over a file or directory \(o\):

\[ \rho_{H,o} := \begin{cases} \dfrac{\lambda_{H,o}}{|H|} & \text{if } |H| \ne 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]

### 3.7 Author Metrics

Authorship test:

\[ \mathbb{I}(a, h) := \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } a = h[a] \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]

**Author Modifications** on a file or directory \(o \in H[F] \cup H[D]\):

\[ n_{H,o,a} := \sum_{h \in H} \mathbb{I}(a, h) \cdot \mathbb{I}^n(h,o) \]

**Author Churn** on a file or directory \(o \in H[F] \cup H[D]\):

\[ \lambda_{H,o,a} := \sum_{h \in H} \lambda_{h,o} \cdot \mathbb{I}(a, h) \]

**Author Ownership:** the fraction of churn on file or directory \(o \in H[F] \cup H[D]\) from an author \(a\):

\[ \omega_{H,o,a} := \begin{cases} \dfrac{\lambda_{H,o,a}}{\lambda_{H,o}} & \text{if } \lambda_{H,o} \ne 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]

## 4. Rubric

Requirements are cumulative. You can only reach a tier if the previous tier is satisfied. Each tier is judged holistically.

Metric correctness is determined against a set of test repositories. Sample metrics from each of these repos will be provided from a specific commit hash. These repos are open source.

Provided repositories:

- **cJSON** — https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON.git
